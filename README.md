# Java-Lab-10
Project from course teaching Java

This program scans a grid of 1's and 0's given in a txt file and determines whether or not it is possible to traverse from the start coordinate to the end coordinate given by the user "stepping" only on 1's.

How to run:

1. Type the following commands into the command window/terminal

javac Main.java

java Main

2. Type in starting and ending coordinates as prompted.
  NOTE: the grid given in this repository is 4 x 6, so the x-coordinate must be less than 4 and the y coordinate must be less than 6.
